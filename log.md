# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 8th, 2020

##### 100 Days of Code Setup - Starting Tomorrow

**Today's Progress**: Cleared out SSD Drive, Networked, Set Up Repository

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start this with some support. Chase and Sandra are both starting tomorrow, so I might as well just get on it. I don't have any excuse not to. Before I get into any projects, I'll probably spend the first week or so working on JavaScript algorithms supplied by bootcamp curriculum, or working on jQuery activities to prepare for the interview on Monday.

### Day 1: October 9th, 2020

##### JavaScript Algorithms Part 1

**Today's Progress**: Worked through first three folders in Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little rusty with JavaScript and a little cocky at the same time. Worked through 8-9 algorithms and tried to get clever with a few of them, which ended up slowing me down in the end. However, end results were good overall.

### Day 2: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 4 and 5 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** The algorithms are getting much harder. In particular, I got stuck on the "is-numeric" one which takes in a string and determines if it is a number. Some really ugly code there, but after looking at the solved file, I realized there isn't a simple, elegant solution. That's 8 completed algorithms today.

### Day 3: October 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folder 6 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Got really stuck on the first one out of the gate: "character-count". Spent about 45 minutes on that one alone, and was frustrated after solving it and looking at the suggested solution. It was something I had tried, but I kept getting an error that my key was not recognized, so I went around the problem a different way. I'm still happy with my solution, but it shows I need a lot more practice with manipulating objects. Only completed 3 algorithms today.

### Day 4: October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 7, 8, and 9 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Much smoother algorithms today. A few of them I was able to pass on my first test, which felt really good. I guess I'm getting better at writing this code and envisioning arrays in my head. I noticed a lot of the solutions are using object mapping for arrays, so I think I need to look into that more and try to understand how that works. It seems like it may be a good alternative to looping through arrays in some situations. Completed 9 algorithms today.

### Day 5: October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 10, 11, and 12 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Decent work today, but folder 9 was a killer in terms of writing attractive code. I was able to find solutions to each algorithm, but folder 9 solutions were clearly not best solutions, and felt quite forced. I'm definitely getting better with array methods such as map, and sort, but I also feel like I'm looping too much and in terms of Big O, I have to find ways to loop less. Completed 9 algorithms today. I have two more days left of algorithms unless I get really stuck.

### Day 6: October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folder 13, and on algorithm in folder 14 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Wow, folder 14 is a huge leap in difficulty. Folder 13 went okay, but then I was just floored by folder 14. I was able to get the first one done, and although probably not as efficient as it could be, I don't have the solved solutions to that folder. Good thing is that there's only one for loop! Only solved 4 algorithms today, and it looks like the last 4 folders are going to be a battle.

### Day 7: October 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on open issues with my React Portfolio.

**Thoughts** Decided to take a break from algorithms for a second. I had some open issues on my React Portfolio that I wanted to address. Updated the footer, the link to Study Check, fixed the home page so clicking on my name won't redirect and refresh the project list, and finally worked on the hamburger menu in mobile. That last part took most of the time, but I have it very close to how I want it to be. Right now, to make it work, I have the LinkedIn and Github links as list items within the Nav, but ideally I'd like those on the header portion instead, and always visible, even in mobile. Not bad progress.
