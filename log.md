# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 8th, 2020

##### 100 Days of Code Setup - Starting Tomorrow

**Today's Progress**: Cleared out SSD Drive, Networked, Set Up Repository

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start this with some support. Chase and Sandra are both starting tomorrow, so I might as well just get on it. I don't have any excuse not to. Before I get into any projects, I'll probably spend the first week or so working on JavaScript algorithms supplied by bootcamp curriculum, or working on jQuery activities to prepare for the interview on Monday.

### Day 1: October 9th, 2020

##### JavaScript Algorithms Part 1

**Today's Progress**: Worked through first three folders in Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little rusty with JavaScript and a little cocky at the same time. Worked through 8-9 algorithms and tried to get clever with a few of them, which ended up slowing me down in the end. However, end results were good overall.

### Day 2: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 4 and 5 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** The algorithms are getting much harder. In particular, I got stuck on the "is-numeric" one which takes in a string and determines if it is a number. Some really ugly code there, but after looking at the solved file, I realized there isn't a simple, elegant solution. That's 8 completed algorithms today.

### Day 3: October 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folder 6 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Got really stuck on the first one out of the gate: "character-count". Spent about 45 minutes on that one alone, and was frustrated after solving it and looking at the suggested solution. It was something I had tried, but I kept getting an error that my key was not recognized, so I went around the problem a different way. I'm still happy with my solution, but it shows I need a lot more practice with manipulating objects. Only completed 3 algorithms today.

### Day 4: October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 7, 8, and 9 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Much smoother algorithms today. A few of them I was able to pass on my first test, which felt really good. I guess I'm getting better at writing this code and envisioning arrays in my head. I noticed a lot of the solutions are using object mapping for arrays, so I think I need to look into that more and try to understand how that works. It seems like it may be a good alternative to looping through arrays in some situations.
