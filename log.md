##### 100 Days of Code Setup - Starting Tomorrow

**Today's Progress**: Cleared out SSD Drive, Networked, Set Up Repository

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start this with some support. Chase and Sandra are both starting tomorrow, so I might as well just get on it. I don't have any excuse not to. Before I get into any projects, I'll probably spend the first week or so working on JavaScript algorithms supplied by bootcamp curriculum, or working on jQuery activities to prepare for the interview on Monday.

### Day 1: October 9th, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
