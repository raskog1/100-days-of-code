# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### 100 Days of Code Setup - Starting Tomorrow

**Today's Progress**: Cleared out SSD Drive, Networked, Set Up Repository

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start this with some support. Chase and Sandra are both starting tomorrow, so I might as well just get on it. I don't have any excuse not to. Before I get into any projects, I'll probably spend the first week or so working on JavaScript algorithms supplied by bootcamp curriculum, or working on jQuery activities to prepare for the interview on Monday.

### Day 1: October 9th, 2020

##### JavaScript Algorithms Part 1

**Today's Progress**: Worked through first three folders of algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little rusty with JavaScript and a little cocky at the same time. Worked through 8-9 algorithms and tried to get clever with a few of them, which ended up slowing me down in the end. However, end results were good overall.

### Day 2: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
