# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 8th, 2020

##### 100 Days of Code Setup - Starting Tomorrow

**Today's Progress**: Cleared out SSD Drive, Networked, Set Up Repository

**Thoughts:** Wanted to start this with some support. Chase and Sandra are both starting tomorrow, so I might as well just get on it. I don't have any excuse not to. Before I get into any projects, I'll probably spend the first week or so working on JavaScript algorithms supplied by bootcamp curriculum, or working on jQuery activities to prepare for the interview on Monday.

### Day 1: October 9th, 2020

##### JavaScript Algorithms Part 1

**Today's Progress**: Worked through first three folders in Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: I'm a little rusty with JavaScript and a little cocky at the same time. Worked through 8-9 algorithms and tried to get clever with a few of them, which ended up slowing me down in the end. However, end results were good overall.

### Day 2: October 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 4 and 5 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** The algorithms are getting much harder. In particular, I got stuck on the "is-numeric" one which takes in a string and determines if it is a number. Some really ugly code there, but after looking at the solved file, I realized there isn't a simple, elegant solution. That's 8 completed algorithms today.

### Day 3: October 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folder 6 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Got really stuck on the first one out of the gate: "character-count". Spent about 45 minutes on that one alone, and was frustrated after solving it and looking at the suggested solution. It was something I had tried, but I kept getting an error that my key was not recognized, so I went around the problem a different way. I'm still happy with my solution, but it shows I need a lot more practice with manipulating objects. Only completed 3 algorithms today.

### Day 4: October 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 7, 8, and 9 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Much smoother algorithms today. A few of them I was able to pass on my first test, which felt really good. I guess I'm getting better at writing this code and envisioning arrays in my head. I noticed a lot of the solutions are using object mapping for arrays, so I think I need to look into that more and try to understand how that works. It seems like it may be a good alternative to looping through arrays in some situations. Completed 9 algorithms today.

### Day 5: October 13th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folders 10, 11, and 12 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Decent work today, but folder 9 was a killer in terms of writing attractive code. I was able to find solutions to each algorithm, but folder 9 solutions were clearly not best solutions, and felt quite forced. I'm definitely getting better with array methods such as map, and sort, but I also feel like I'm looping too much and in terms of Big O, I have to find ways to loop less. Completed 9 algorithms today. I have two more days left of algorithms unless I get really stuck.

### Day 6: October 14th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed folder 13, and on algorithm in folder 14 in Algorithms.

**Thoughts** Wow, folder 14 is a huge leap in difficulty. Folder 13 went okay, but then I was just floored by folder 14. I was able to get the first one done, and although probably not as efficient as it could be, I don't have the solved solutions to that folder. Good thing is that there's only one for loop! Only solved 4 algorithms today, and it looks like the last 4 folders are going to be a battle.

### Day 7: October 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on open issues with my React Portfolio.

**Thoughts** Decided to take a break from algorithms for a second. I had some open issues on my React Portfolio that I wanted to address. Updated the footer, the link to Study Check, fixed the home page so clicking on my name won't redirect and refresh the project list, and finally worked on the hamburger menu in mobile. That last part took most of the time, but I have it very close to how I want it to be. Right now, to make it work, I have the LinkedIn and Github links as list items within the Nav, but ideally I'd like those on the header portion instead, and always visible, even in mobile. Not bad progress.

### Day 8: October 16th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started some back end work on Renossance project.

**Thoughts** Today I wanted to work on a project, so I started on back end validation and authorization for my Renossance project which I'm designing to be used in our renovation at the hotel. The Express server and MongoDB Atlas database had already been set up, so I worked on the User model, and also validation checks in the course of creating a new user. All tested and working via Postman, so up next is JWT before I get to more of the fun stuff.

### Day 9: October 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on backend for Renossance project.

**Thoughts** I wanted to continue with the Renossance projects, so I set up JWT today for authorization and tested all authentication routes. I mirrored this after Traversy's Udemy course on MERN, and it's my second time through it. This time around, I picked up a lot more, and can identify ways to gear things for my specific project, and I seem to understand the whole process much better. Next step is setting up routes for Location, which involves a lot of nested elements. At the end of our Project 3, I had a world of trouble accessing nested elements.

### Day 10: October 21st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started private project (Explore).

**Thoughts** After a couple days with no electricity, so no wifi, I got electricity back to most of the house.  However, my main PC is still inoperable, so it's been difficult to code.  Today, I was able to get my laptop charged and bang out the initial back end framework for a new, private project I'm working on.  I'm having a hard time imagining the database structure, and I also need to figure out how to store images in a database, so it will be a good learning project.  We may get power back to my PC tomorrow.

### Day 11: October 22nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tech assessment.

**Thoughts** Nothing to commit today as I spent the majority of my time on a tech assessment...which did not go well at all.  Just goes to show how rusty I am at SQL.

### Day 12: October 23rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More backend work on Renossance.

**Thoughts** Glad to get back into the project.  I worked on the models a bit and decided to move the room portion to a separate Schema.  Worked on and tested routes to create a new location, add (currently logged in) user to a specified location, and add rooms to a specified location.  I also tested using a Schema within a Schema, but I don't really see any difference between using that versus a string with an ID.  I might play around with that a little bit more.

### Day 13: October 24th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Even more backend work on Renossance.

**Thoughts** Struggled a bit today as I typically do when working with arrays within objects in a database.  I keep on wanting to use Mongoose methods to work through arrays and update, but either I'm not good enough at that yet, or it just makes more sense to use JavaScript.  Anyway, after messing around for way too long with Mongoose, I threw in a simple for loop to find a tracker by name, and toggle it.  I may go back to that and refine it later...not sure how efficient that solution is.  More Mongoose review in the future to not get hung up on stuff like this.  Can now add trackers to a given room ID.  Features to follow, then maybe I'll get started on some front end stuff.

### Day 14: October 25th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Starting on frontend for Renossance.

**Thoughts** Started the dive into Material UI today as I wanted to get some things going for the frontend.  Created the React app, and got some basics completed.  Set up a color theme based off of the Sacramento Kings official colors, played around with buttons, forms, and text-inputs with Material UI and did some reading on their color theory.  Had issues with a dark background and not being able to change the input fields to a white outline, so I have a lighter background in there for now until I figure out how to manipulate that.  Material UI looks pretty exciting...it's not just a Bootstrap knockoff.  So I'm excited to see where it goes.
